Compass Contracting, Inc. was established in 1994 as a full service commercial and industrial, structural maintenance and waterproofing company. Collectively, our project management team has 60 years and our field supervision has 61 years experience in the building restoration and waterproofing trade.

We are a local company based in Hampton, Virginia and provide service throughout Virginia and northeast North Carolina. We have performed work for most all of the local municipalities, as well as State and Federal Government installations. In addition, we have worked on many high profile commercial projects, museums, historic properties, hospitals and industrial facilities.

Compass Contracting has the in-house capabilities to develop comprehensive restoration specifications for our clients. What distinguishes us is our ability to approach a problem individually and creatively. Because each problem requires teamwork, we work closely with our clients and manufacturers to ensure that the most cost effective repair solution is achieved, using up-to-date construction repair technology and our broad base of practical work experience.

We have an active on-site safety program, which is attuned not only to the safety of our personnel and equipment, but also to the building's occupants. Safety is of the utmost importance to us, as indicated by our Workman's Compensation Experience Modifier of .079.

We would gladly welcome the opportunity to meet with you and discuss your restoration needs.
