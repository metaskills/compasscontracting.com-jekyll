Sika products were chosen to be used on this project and included 
concrete patching mortars, epoxy resins, elastomeric coatings, anti-corrosion 
inhibitors, and caulking sealants. The work was to be done during 
the school's summer break, resulting in a very tight completion 
schedule.

Compass contracting self-performed 100% of the work on this project. 
Sam Neighbors, Vice President, acted as project manager and Frank 
Hernandez was the on-site project foreman. Both Sam and Frank worked 
closely with VA Tech&#8217;s project management and the consulting 
architect, HDH of Christiansburg, VA.

**Repair materials:**

* **Sika Armatec 110** - This product was used to prime the steel rebar and as a bonding agent prior to the placement of the repair mortars.
* **SikaTop 121 Plus** - This product was used to rub out bug holes and minor surface defects in the concrete surfaces.
* **SikaRepair SHB** - This product was used to hand patch vertical, horizontal and overhead spall repairs.
* **SikaLatex R** - This product was added to the SikaRepair SHB to increase mortar&#8217;s adhesion in overhead applications.
* **Sikagard Elastocolor** - The product was selected as the elastomeric coating to be applied onto the concrete beams, columns and mechanical penthouse screen wall panels. This product provided both a means of sealing the concrete and a uniform coloration of the structure.
* **SikaFlex 1A** - This product was used in the routing out and sealing of cracks in the concrete beams and columns.
* **Sikadur Combiflex**
* **Sika MonoTop 611** - This product was selected as the material to use in the form and pour repairs of deeply spalled areas, which exceeded 2&#8221; in depth.
* **Sikadur Epoxy Broad-Cast Overlay System** - This systems was chosen as the waterproofing for the horizontal surfaces of the concrete beams.
