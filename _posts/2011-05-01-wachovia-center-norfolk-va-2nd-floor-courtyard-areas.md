Compass Contracting has completed work on the 2nd Floor Courtyard areas of the new Wachovia Center located in downtown Norfolk, VA. The courtyards contained various elements such as raised planters, planting beds, fountains and pools, along with fire pits.

Compass Contracting was selected to install the hot fluid-applied waterproofing on the structural decks, install garden roof components in the vegetated areas, and install the raised pedestal paver assembly throughout the courtyard areas. Sam Neighbors was the project manager and Frank Hernandez was the on-site project foreman.

**Selected Materials:**

* American Hydrotech MM6125 Reinforced, Hot Fluid-Applied, Rubberized Asphalt Waterproofing System.
* American Hydrotech Garden Roof Components including Engineered Soils.
* Hanover Architectural Concrete Pavers and Adjustable Support Pedestals.

**Additional Work:**

All of the Center’s balconies were waterproofed using American Hydrotech’s MM6125 Reinforced, Hot Fluid-Applied, Rubberized Asphalt Waterproofing System. The system was used in a split-slab waterproofing application.
