<img class="service-large" src="{{ 'services/masonry-restoration.jpg' | asset_path }}" alt="Masonry Restoration">As masonry structures age, several problems can develop. Among these problems are spalling of the brick faces, settlement cracks, efflorescence / staining, deteriorated or open mortar joints, loose bricks, moisture retention and severe weathering. Masonry block can also develop similar problems.

Most masonry is porous in nature and absorbs moisture. Over time this can lead to problems depending on various factors; the rate of absorption, the wall's ability to relieve itself of any moisture accumulation, and severe weather exposure just to name a few.

It would be erroneous to assume that weather alone is the cause of problems in masonry wall construction. Therefore, it is important to determine the root cause of the deterioration. Factors such as defective gutters, leaking roofs and roof flashings, leaking seals at thru-wall penetrations, such as windows and louvers, can all cause problems in masonry construction. Problems, such as these, should be dealt with prior to beginning any masonry restoration. Failure to eliminate the source of the problem will only allow the masonry deterioration to continue and any repairs made would be a waste of time and money.

**Typical examples of repairs to correct problems in masonry wall construction would be:**

* Tuckpointing
* Random Brick Replacement
* Repair / Replacement of Window Heads &amp; Sills
* Installation of Weeps
* Cleaning, Sealing &amp; Coating
* Installation of Expansion Joints
* Rebuilding Dislodged or Severely Damaged Sections
