Water repellants will greatly reduce the rate at which these materials absorb moisture. As a rule, water repellants have little if any crack bridging ability and will not be as effective on surfaces that have cracks or defective joints. There are basically two categories of water repellants, penetrating and surface set. Water repellants are primarily used in above-grade applications.

Waterproof coatings provide a complete seal over the surfaces to which they are applied. These coatings are primarily used on non-traffic surfaces and vertical applications. There are many types of waterproof coating categories designed for specific applications. There are acrylic polymer elastomeric coatings, silicone based elastomeric coatings, cementitious coatings, epoxy coatings, etc. There are also reinforced and unreinforced systems as well. Almost all of these coatings are available in a wide range of standard colors and custom colors can be made if required. Most of these coatings do have limited crack bridging abilities.

**Typical applications for these products would be as follows:**

## Water Repellants

* Parking Garage Decks
* Balconies
* Exposed Concrete Surfaces (vertical &amp; horizontal)
* Masonry (brick &amp; block)
* Exposed Wooden Construction
* Natural Stone

## Waterproof Coatings

* Masonry Walls (brick &amp; block)
* Exposed Concrete Surfaces (vertical)
* Exposed Wooden Construction (vertical)Terracotta
* Exterior Insulated and Finish Systems (EIFS)

Using the wrong type of sealer or coating in the wrong application can result in poor performance or failure of the product. Things to consider when selecting a sealer or coating would be:

* Type of Surface to be treated
* Type of surface preparation needed to meet manufacturer's requirements
* Expected service life
* Aesthetics
* Application rates
* Compatibility with existing coatings or surface treatments

Compass Contracting is an approved applicator for several different manufacturers and can help our clients to choose the best system for their needs. We also use our manufacturer's field representatives to assist in the proper selection of materials and for periodic inspections throughout the installation process.
